# CREDS/CXREF: https://www.jwillikers.com/automate-flatpak-updates-with-systemd

# This is essentially the long way to enable an automatic Flatpak update
# like you'll see in the MATE GUI:
#
#   MATE Menu > Update Manager > Edit > Preference
#     Automation > âœ“ Update Flatpaks automatically
#
# ALTHO: Update Manager says "Performed when you log in", but the timer
#  set by this task runs daily. So if you don't login often (e.g., I just
#  lock my machine, mostly), the Update Manager approach won't always keep
#  your Flatpak apps up to date.
#
# Note also you won't see the "Update Flatpaks automatically" option
# enabled in the GUI when using this approach. But it'll be running.

# CXREF:
#   /etc/systemd/user/update-user-flatpaks.service
#   /etc/systemd/user/update-user-flatpaks.timer

# REFER: Note this is a user timer:
#   systemctl --user list-timers
